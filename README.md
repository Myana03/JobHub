# JobHub
Built a Spring Boot backend for a job hub, featuring REST APIs for job retrieval by ID, posting, and listing. Verified functionality with Postman, ensuring robust performance and seamless database integration.


Developed a robust backend system using Spring Boot to manage job listings and operations efficiently. Leveraging RESTful principles, the application allows seamless interaction with job data stored in a database. Key features include:

Job Retrieval: Implementing endpoints to fetch job details based on unique IDs, ensuring precise retrieval of job listings.

Job Posting: Enabling endpoints for posting new job openings, facilitating easy addition of job opportunities into the system.

Job Listing View: Providing endpoints to view all available job listings, supporting comprehensive visibility and search functionalities.

Verification with Postman: Rigorously tested API endpoints using Postman, ensuring reliability and functionality across various HTTP methods (GET, POST).

This project showcases proficiency in Spring Boot, REST API design, and integration with database operations, enhancing the efficiency of managing and accessing job-related information.
